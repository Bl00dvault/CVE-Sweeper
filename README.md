# CVE-Sniffer
a python script for correlating community snort rules to Nessus output  

## Usage 
Not a lot to it. The script takes a directory input and parses all Nessus .csv files and correlates to community.rules (Snort community rules) in the same directory. It's a short script so anything you need to change it should be easy to find at the top. Enjoy!
